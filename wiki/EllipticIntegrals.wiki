= Elliptic Integrals =

Elliptic integrals originally arose in connection with the problem of giving the arc length of an ellipse. They were first studied by Giulio Fagnano and Leonhard Euler. Modern mathematics defines an elliptic integral as any function `f(x)` which can be expressed in the form

http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f(x)=\int^x_cR(t,P(t))\,dt%.png

where `R` is a rational function of its two arguments, `P` is the square root of a polynomial of degree `3` or `4` with no repeated roots, and `c` is a constant.
In general, elliptic integrals cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. Exceptions to this general rule are when `P` has repeated roots, or when `R(x,y)` contains no odd powers of `y`. However, with the appropriate reduction formula, every elliptic integral can be brought into a form that involves integrals over rational functions and the three canonical forms (i.e. the elliptic integrals of the first, second and third kind).

Elliptic integrals have many applications, for example in mathematics and physics

 * arc-length of plane curves (ellipse, hyperbola, Bernoulli's lemniscate)
 * surface are of ellipsoid in 3-dimensional space
 * electric and magnetic field associated with ellipsoid
 * periodicity of an an-harmonic oscillator
 * mutual inductance of coaxial circles
 * age of the universe in the Friedman model

== Numerical evaluation ==
Numerical evaluation of the elliptic integrals are based on various expansion in terms of elementary and transcendental functions.

=== The arithmetic-geometric mean ===
The arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM) of two positive real numbers x and y is defined as follows:
First compute the arithmetic mean of x and y and call it a1. Next compute the geometric mean of x and y and call it g1; this is the square root of the product xy:


Then iterate this operation with a1 taking the place of x and g1 taking the place of y. In this way, two sequences (an) and (gn) are defined:


These two sequences converge to the same number, which is the arithmetic-geometric mean of x and y; it is denoted by M(x, y), or sometimes by agm(x, y).
This can be used for algorithmic purposes as in the AGM method.
